* First, we need to parse the YAML file and convert it into a data structure

PERFORM parse-yaml-file USING "file.yaml".

* Then we can iterate through the nodes in the data structure

PERFORM VARYING node-index FROM 1 BY 1
    UNTIL node-index > number-of-nodes
    PERFORM process-node USING node-index
END-PERFORM.

* parse-yaml-file subroutine

* Pseudo code to parse the YAML file and convert it into a data structure

PROCEDURE DIVISION USING file-name.
    OPEN INPUT file-name.
    READ file-name INTO record.
    PERFORM UNTIL end-of-file
        * Parse the record and add it to the data structure
        ADD record TO data-structure.
        READ file-name INTO record.
    END-PERFORM.
    CLOSE file-name.
END-PROCEDURE.

* process-node subroutine

* Pseudo code to process a single node in the data structure

PROCEDURE DIVISION USING node-index.
    MOVE data-structure(node-index) TO node.
    * Process the node as needed
    * ...
END-PROCEDURE.
